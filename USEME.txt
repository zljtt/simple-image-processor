COMMANDS
To use the image processor in a console:
- Start the main with no command-line option. 
- Type in the command after the system prompts you "Please enter command:"
- Then enter the command in a whole line, that is, finish the command line before pressing ENTER / a command cannot be seperated into two lines.
- Command keywords are case sensitive, no upper-case letters in all keywords of commands (keyword means the first token in a command, such as "save").
There are seven types of command:
- load [location of the file to load] [name of the image to be stored in the processor]
	- save the given image from the processor to the file system.
- save [location of the file to save] [name of the image that is stored in the processor]
	- load the given image from the file system to the processor
- color-transfrom [operation type] [name of the original image] [name of the created image] 
	- There are different color-transform opeation types:
		red : create a image with the red-component of the original image.
		green : create a image with the green-component of the original image.
		blue : create a image with the blue-component of the original image.
		value : create a image with the value-component of the original image.
		intensity : create a image with the intensity-component of the original image.
		luma : create a image with the luma-component of the original image. In other words, it is the greyscale command in the homework requirement.
		sepia : create a image with the sepia tone of the original image.
- filter [operation type] [name of the original image] [name of the created image] 
	- There are different filter opeation types:
			blur : create a image of the original image that is blurred.
			sharpen : create a image of the original image that is sharpened.
- flip vertical/horizontal [name of the original image] [name of the created image]
	- create a new image with all pixel of the original image flipped vertically or horizontally
- brighten [value of brightness to increase or decrease] [name of the original image] [name of the created image]
	- negative value indicates darkening the image.
	- positive value indicates brightening the image.
- copy [name of the original image] [name of the created image]
	- copy the original image, and store a clone in the processor with the given name.
- print [name of the image]/all
	- print the image if the second argument is the name of the image.
	- print all images if the second argument is "all".

To use the image processor with a script file as a command-line option.
- Start the main with command-line option. "-file name-of-script.txt", where [name-of-script.txt] is the name of the script command file.
- The file should have one command each line, with no "new line" character (\n or \r\n) at the end of the last line.
- The file should not have any other text other than commands.

** One thing worth notice is that the greyscale command in the last build has now changed into color-transform command. **
** The greyscale command mentioned in the homework requirement is "color-transform luma image-from image-to" in this program. **
